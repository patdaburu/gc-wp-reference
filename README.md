# gc-wp-reference
GeoComm Wordpress Reference Plugin
==================================

This project is a sample WordPress plugin that can be used as a reference template for creating new plugins.  It demonstrates a number of processes including:

  - registering hooks and actions,
  - creating pages that use shortcodes,
  - registering options,
  - creating admin pages,
  - creating custom widgets,
  - creating custom tables,
  - and other interesting stuff.

Installation
------------
1.  Create a directory called `gc-wp-reference` in your [WordPress installation's plugins directory](https://codex.wordpress.org/Determining_Plugin_and_Content_Directories) which can almost certainly be found at `wp-content/plugins`.
2.  Place this project's files under that directory.
3.  Start modifying.

The main point of entry in this project is gc-wp-reference.php.  To allow WordPress to load it correctly, the directory in which it resides should also be called gc-wp-reference as per WordPress conventions.

When you start building your plugin, the first thing you'll want to do is change the names of the directory and the main file to reflect your plugin's name.

Go get 'em.
